# Tic-Tac-Toe Test Minigame

This project was made in Godot as a part of me learning how to mess around with the engine. This is the third project I finish in this modality, the first one being a Pong clone, and the second one being a Break-Out clone. Hope you enjoy it.

You can play the game here: <a href="https://matiashettich.itch.io/tic-tac-toe-minigame-test">Tic-Tac-Toe Test</a>
